This is a very simple music display for streaming overlays.

How to use:
- you need a last.fm account and a Web Scrobbler
- request an API-Key from the last.fm website
- copy the `environment_example.json` file and rename it to `environment.json`
- insert your last.fm API-key and username in the `environment.json` file
- create a new browser-source in OBS and select the html file of your choice (`v2.html` or `fullscreen.html`)
